[Smritle](https://smritle.com) - A Wordle game made for my girlfriend, Smriti.

There is a new word to guess each day. It may be 4, 5, or 6 letters long. Proper nouns are included, and you can easily edit the word list to use specific words or simply pull from the dictionary.

Here is an example game:

I guessed "ONION" because each letter is close to the middle of the alphabet.

Because I got "N" correct, the first letter must be "A", "E", "I", or K (unlikely). I chose to try "E" since it's closest to half-way between "A" and "N" alphabetically. And I tried to make the other conditions work to create a valid word.

My third guess was straight-forward since I knew word starts with "IND" and the only other words I know are "INDEX" and "INDIE", neither or which meet the conditions from the second guess.
